# About

This project uses jQuery to create contact cards, of which can be dragged around screen or hidden. Creating contact cards also uses front-end jQuery validations.

Note: This project is for desktop browsers only, as was a quick example of jQuery and jQuery UI used together quickly to create cool front-end features. A backend could be built into this, as well as mobile responsiveness.
